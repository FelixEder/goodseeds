### About
Goodseeds is a website where you can search for different kinds of plants, create your own garden in your profile page and check what's the most popular plant at the moment. You can also read details about and review plants and set reminders to water the plants in your garden.

### How to set up
First, clone this repo to your local machine. In order to make the project work locally with npm, checkout the branch *runLocally*. This branch is set up to use a token for the trefle api configured for localhost:3000, otherwise this branch is an exact copy of master. After checking out the branch, run the command *npm start* and a web page should automatically open up in your browser. If not, manually go to *localhost:3000* to see the web page run locally.
