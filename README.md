# goodseeds

### About
Goodseeds is a website where you can search for different kinds of plants, create your own garden in your profile page and check what's the most popular plant at the moment. You can also read details about and review plants and set reminders to water the plants in your garden.

### What we have done

A number of actions and reducers have been done for plants and reviews, such as addPlant, waterPlant and addReview. they have yet to be integrated into the whole app because some of the functionality have not been done yet.
We have also created the necessary collections in Firestore that we will use. The structure in those collections may be updated as we discover new problems.
### What we have yet to do

At the moment we have only done very basic styling. We will try to use bootstrap in order to create the styling for the app.
